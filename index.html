              Marvel Comics is the brand name and primary imprint of Marvel
              Worldwide Inc., formerly Marvel Publishing, Inc. and Marvel Comics
              Group, a publisher of American comic books and related media. In
              2009, The Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel Entertainment,
              Marvel Worldwide's parent company. Marvel started in 1939 as
              Timely Publications, and by the early 1950s, had generally become
              known as Atlas Comics. The Marvel branding began in 1961, the year
              that the company launched The Fantastic Four and other superhero
              titles created by Steve Ditko, Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and many
              others. Marvel counts among its characters such well-known
              superheroes as Spider-Man, Captain America, Iron Man, Thor,
              Wolverine, the Hulk, Daredevil, Ghost Rider, Deadpool, Doctor
              Strange, Black Panther and the Punisher, such teams as the
              Avengers, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four and the Guardians of the
              Galaxy, and antagonists including Doctor Doom, Red Skull, Green
              Goblin, Thanos, Ultron, Doctor Octopus, Magneto, Venom and Loki.
              Most of Marvel's fictional characters operate in a single reality
              known as the Marvel Universe, with most locations mirroring
              real-life places; many major characters are based in New York
              City.
